//first disable the autocompile from all oter scss files except the this/current file
//Important note : try to consider the piriority of the file that you will going to add first ...ie: if we have variables located in f1 and  a mixin located in f2 but the mixin depends/USE the variables in f1 so we have to import f1 the f2




// "tables" uses/dependsOn "mixin" so we have to import "mixin" first
//this is how to import a file
@import "mixin";
@import "tables";




//include a mixin to some classes
.kid,.motive{
    @include mix1;
}
 

.T1,.T2{
@include mix2;
    }
